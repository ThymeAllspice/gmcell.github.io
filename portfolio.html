            <h3>Hello! My name is Grace and I am currently working to get my Master's degree under the guidance of Dr. Warren in Geology at the University of Delaware. I got my Bachelor's degree at the University of Minnesota Duluth (also in Geology) and grew up in Eau Claire, WI. My area of study focuses on peridotites formed at mid-ocean ridges and the following deformation that they experience at transform faults. 

In my free time, I like to hike, climb, and run for exercise. I draw, play my bass guitar, and read any good fantasy or sci-fi book with my birds Thyme and Allspice.</h3>

            <h3>I’m at the beginning of my masters program right now and still viewing my research topic of deformed peridoties in a very broad sense. Since I will be doing my field research in the middle of my fall semester, I am not taking or teaching any classes at first here and am instead focusing my time preparing with as much literature and sample study as I can.</h3>
            <h3>I am also filling my time with the making of this website you are currently on! This is my first HTML and CSS project I’ve done and am enjoying the challenge. Over this past summer I took the online course, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design by freeCodeCamp</a>, to gain some experience and am now putting what I’ve learned to the test! Fingers crossed you don’t run into any bugs (if you do, feel free to email me!).</h3>
