            <h3>Hello! My name is Grace and I am currently working to get my Master's degree under the guidance of Dr. Warren in Geology at the University of Delaware. I got my Bachelor's degree at the University of Minnesota Duluth (also in Geology) and grew up in Eau Claire, WI. My area of study focuses on peridotites formed at mid-ocean ridges and the following deformation that they experience at transform faults. 

In my free time, I like to hike, climb, and run for exercise. I draw, play my bass guitar, and read any good fantasy or sci-fi book with my birds Thyme and Allspice.</h3>

            <h2>Current Projects<h2>
            <h3 id="current-projects">I’m at the beginning of my masters program right now and still viewing my research topic of deformed peridoties in a very broad sense under the guidance of my advisor, <a href="https://www.jessicamwarren.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Jessica Warren</a>. Since I will be doing my field research in the middle of my fall semester, I am not taking or teaching any classes at first here and am instead focusing my time preparing with as much literature and sample study as I can.</h3>
            <h3>I am also filling my time with the making of this website you are currently on! This is my first HTML and CSS project I’ve done and am enjoying the challenge. Over this past summer I took the online course, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design" target="_blank">Responsive Web Design by freeCodeCamp</a>, to gain some experience and am now putting what I’ve learned to the test! Fingers crossed you don’t run into any bugs (if you do, feel free to email me!).</h3>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Research</h3>
            <h3>In my final year of my bachelor’s degree (2025) at the University of Minnesota Duluth, I completed a one-year research project, funded through UMD’s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). <a href="https://scse.d.umn.edu/faculty-staff/dr-michael-braunagel-phd" target="_blank">Dr. Michael Braunagel</a> served as my research advisor at this time, providing much-needed guidance as this was my first time creating a research project. My study focused on the deformation surrounding the Douglas Fault, located in northern Wisconsin and central Minnesota. This deformation was accommodated differently by the two main rock units along the fault, the Chengwatana Volcanics and the overlying Bayfield Group Sandstones. Results of the study are outlined below in the poster I presented at UMD’s research symposium.</h3>

            <h3>Following shortly after this conference, I also presented my research at the Institute of Lake Superior Geology (ILSG) Conference in 2025, combining my research with two of my classmates, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raeann-vogel-9a0872354/" target="_blank">Raeann Vogel</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nate-daniels-021994265/" target="_blank">Nate Daniels</a>, who also worked under the guidance of Dr. Braunagel. This poster provided a bigger-picture interpretation of the deformation mechanisms as well as timing of faulting and deformation.</h3>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Environmental Assessment Internship</h3>
            <h3>For over a year during my undergrad, I worked as an intern with <a href="https://www.msa-ps.com/" target="_blank">MSA Professional Services Inc.</a>, based out of Duluth, Minnesota. My main project that I was hired on for was working with <a href="https://www.tu.org/" target="_blank">Trout Unlimited</a> to quality check road-stream crossings in the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, located in northern Wisconsin. This was a sweaty few months of collecting data about culverts and bridges. Besides this project, I assisted on many others, visiting contaminated sites that needed to have their underground storage tanks (USTs) removed, their contaminated soil excavated, soil and water tested, and wetland reports made.</h3>
            <h3 class="subtitle">Undergraduate Field Camp</h3>
            <h3>I participated in the Wasatch-Uinta field camp in the summer of 2024, studying the structures formed in the Laramide Orogeny surrounding Salt Lake City, Utah. During my time there, I took a lot of strikes and dips, made interpretive geologic maps and cross sections.</h3>
